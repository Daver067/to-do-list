# to-do-list

Odin Project to-do List

A functional to-do list using separate JS files and modules.

Attempting to use the SOLID principals and OOP.

Re-arranged my code a couple of times to try and keep it as organized and easy to follow as possible.
In the future I may come back and add in a local storage.


Webpack will also be used on this project, will try uploading my first library with it.

Learning outcome:
Still a lot of trouble figuring out where to put components and functions in order to make the code more readable.
Half way through I used a file for my module maker which brought up the input form, I realized a little too late that this was a pretty effecient
way to keep my code separate. You can see from me mashing a lot of functions in the actual toDo and Project classes that do rendering.
I think If I would have kept each area of the page as its own js file it would have been a lot cleaner than something such as the "eventListener" js file 
I used... Which was more of a headache than I orginally estimated

I noticed a little while into this project I was supposed to add expected finish dates into the toDos... sorry Odin I missed that and didnt rework it in.

Webpack gave me a bit of a whirl while I was trying to do my original design of the website. The way I currently do it is build the site using html
and give the design with css. I then take the html out and re-render everything with javascript.
I had to do quite a bit of research into webpack in order for the new index.html file it created to keep my inputs from the index in my src file.

I think a lot more of my page running functions should link back to my index.html, but I am unsure about how to go about that. I currently feel like my code is a little bit like a choose your own adventure book for finding what its doing.

Laying out new features to work on in a book felt very productive, and gave me better insight on to how to better present my pseudocode.

Overall, building new functions and working in new features felt very smooth. I felt most of my new implementations worked on the first try and I really feel like I'm picking up fluency in JS. However, I do need to do more prep work on my file structure and planning. I feel as if my boolean checks are a bit of a cheat and there would be better ways to implement active projects or editting todos if I would have thought ahead better.
